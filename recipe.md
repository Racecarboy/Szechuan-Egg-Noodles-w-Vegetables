    The Recipe (based on what my mom says) - 
1.  Pour oil in a skillet
2.  Add red chilli flakes and grated garlic
3.  Add vegetables and stir fry in high flames until it's 3/4ths cooked
4.  Add salt and schzewan stir fry sauce
5.  Separately you need to cook the noodles and drain water (also scramble the eggs right after that).
6.  Add the noodles to the skillet and add soy sauce and egg
7.  Mix it and leave it on low flames for 5 minutes
8.  You finished! :)
